# CVE-2025-0514

CVE-2025-0514
Executable hyperlink Windows path targets executed unconditionally on activation.

LibreOffice has a feature where hyperlinks in a document can be activated by CTRL+click. Under Windows the link can be passed to the system ShellExecute function for handling. LibreOffice uses a mechanism to block paths to executable targets to ShellExecute to avoid attempting to launch executables.

In versious < 24.8.5 this mechanism could be bypassed by use of non-file URLs that could be interpreted by ShellExecute as Windows file paths.

In the fixed versions this circumvention has been blocked. All Windows users are recommended to upgrade to LibreOffice >= 24.8.5.
