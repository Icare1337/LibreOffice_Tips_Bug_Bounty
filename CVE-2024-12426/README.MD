# CVE-2024-12426

## Title: CVE-2024-12426: URL Fetching Can Be Used to Exfiltrate Arbitrary INI File Values and Environment Variables  

- **Announced:** January 7, 2025  
- **Fixed in:** LibreOffice 24.8.4  

## Description  

URLs could be constructed to expand environmental variables or INI file values, potentially allowing sensitive information to be exfiltrated to a remote server when opening a document containing such links.  

Prior to this fix, documents could include links leveraging an internal feature that expanded environmental variables and INI file values in URLs. In the fixed version, this expansion feature is no longer available in document-hosted URLs.  

**Users are recommended to upgrade to LibreOffice 24.8.4 to mitigate this issue.**
